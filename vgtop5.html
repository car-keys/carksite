                        <li>Great writing, with an interesting setting and slightly wacky yet relatable characters.<br>
                            Some of the best turn-based rpg combat, with dynamic roles for each party member.<br>
                            Really just a masterpiece through-and-through.

                        <li>the only game i've ever seriously speedran. <i>perfect</i> platformer movement, great and <br>
                            challenging levels, and a cute story to boot.

                        <li>Probably the most beautiful pixel art I've seen. Super interesting and unique survival gameplay,<br>
                            Expecting creativiy and mastery from the player and brutally punishing mistakes.<br>
                            Interesting lore and world, mixing post-apocolyptic, lovecraftian, and buddist-style imagery and themes.

                        <li>
                            Frantic, adrenaline-pumping, rewarding. Nuclear Throne <i>nails</i> that classic roguelike progression <br>
                            of sucking, then learing more and getting better till your finally overcome. Much has been said on the<br>
                            gamefeel, and that results in a game that just feels good in the hands. I just love how in ~15 minutes<br>
                            i can consistantly have such a fun and blood-pumping time.
