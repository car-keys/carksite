            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>1-10 scores suck. The problem is, nobody cares <i>just</i> how much you like a show. The difference between a 7 and a 8 is irrelevant -- only that you like one show more than another.<br>
            But we dont need a score for that -- we have top 10s, tier lists, and even full rankings. So then, why else would scores be useful?</p>
            
            <p>Recommendations. If someone you trust gives a movie a 9, you know that its probably something you like. Likewise, a 5 or below tells you its a waste of time. But why have so many levels?<br>Again, 
            its not very clear whether 6-8s are reccomendations. You could say they are "unsure" scores, but honestly I'd rather people make up their damn mind.</p>
            
            <p>And so, I present <b>The Binary Scale.</b> It's simple. Everything you score gets either a <b>0</b>, or a <b>1</b>. A true or a false. a "Skip this", or "Watch This".<br>
            Everything listed with a 0 I deem not worth your time to watch/play/listen. Sure they may have some redeeming qualities, but that doesn't matter; its not worth bothering and the score clearly communicates that.<br>
            Likewise, you should check out all these 1s. Or dont. Its up to you.</p>
