                i am so tired of peeing.<br>
                i drink the water, which i apparently <i>need</i> to <i>live</i> or something,<br>
                and then I have to go put the water somewhere else five minutes later. i drink the water,<br> 
                i go to a place to un-drink the water,<br>
                i wash my hands,<br>
                and then I have to drink <i>more</i> water.<br>
                guess where that water ends up? not in me!<br>
                i give the water to my body and like a child it tosses it out and demands more.<br>
                all hours of the day all hours of the night<br>
                no matter what i am doing my life is interrupted by piss<br>
