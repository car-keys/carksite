                ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
                All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>
                <br>
                “Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
                Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;The frumious Bandersnatch!”<br>
                <br>
                He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br>
                So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;And stood awhile in thought.<br>
                <br>
                And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
                Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;And burbled as it came!<br>
                <br>
                One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
                He left it dead, and with its head<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;He went galumphing back.<br>
                <br>
                “And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
                O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;He chortled in his joy.<br>
                <br>
                ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
                All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>
